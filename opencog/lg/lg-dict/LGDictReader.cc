/**
 * Function to return LG dictionary entries.
 *
 * Given a word string, construct the corresponding atom representing
 * the Link Grammar's dictionary entry.
 *
 * The returned expression is in the form of an opencog-style
 * prefix-notation boolean expression.  Note that it is not in any
 * particular kind of normal form.  In particular, some AND nodes
 * may have only one child: these can be removed.
 *
 * Note that the order of the connectors is important: while linking,
 * these must be satisfied in left-to-right, nested order.
 *
 * Optional clauses are indicated by OR-ing with null, where "null"
 * is a CONNECTOR Node with string-value "0".  Optional clauses are
 * not necessarily in any sort of normal form; the null connector can
 * appear anywhere.
*
* XXX FIXME -- this gives incorrect results if the word has non-trivial
* morphology e.g. if its Russian, and can be split into a stem and a
* suffix.  The problem is that in LG, both stem and suffix count as
* distinct words, and so word splitting must be done first.
 *
 * @param word   the input word string
 * @return       the handle to the newly created atom
